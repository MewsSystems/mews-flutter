///
/// Separate from the semantic colors, this group contains
/// brand-specific colors. These colors are reserved to establish a
/// brand connection across products.
///
/// Accent
///
/// This color needs to be used in either brand-specific variation
/// of the system components or sparingly as an accent element to avoid
/// conflict with the semantic danger color.
///
/// Secondary
///
/// The brand secondary colors are the most versatile and can be used for
/// brand-specific components, system backgrounds, and other neutral
/// elements like cards.
