# Optimus

Optimus is a design system used internally in [Mews](https://github.com/MewsSystems/developers).

The project is under active development. The primary focus is on mobile platforms. Web implementation should work as
well, but bugs and features related to web platform will be of low priority, at least until Flutter support for web
becomes stable.

You can check the storybook with the latest version of components [here](https://mews-optimus.web.app/).
